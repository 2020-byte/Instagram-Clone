Using Next.js, I created a server-side-rendered React application with dynamic routing and client-side navigation. I also used Next.js API routes to create serverless functions for handling user authentication and API requests.

For data storage and management, I used Sanity.io as my headless CMS. This allowed me to easily create and manage my data models and content in a centralized location. I used the Sanity API to fetch data and images from my Sanity project and displayed them on my application.

To replicate the functionality of Instagram, I implemented features such as user authentication, image uploading, likes and comments, and a feed of posts from followed users. I also used Tailwind CSS to style my application and make it responsive for different screen sizes.

Overall, building a clone of Instagram using Next.js and Sanity was a great way to practice working with these technologies and gain experience with building complex, full-stack applications.
